# Alzheimer's Project

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) incurs a significant toll not just on the elderly individuals who are most prone to the disease, but to their caregivers and the population at large. As the sixth leading cause of death among American adults, the disease currently affects 1.6% of the American population, though the figure is projected to double to 3.3% by 2060 as the nation’s population ages and lifespans increase.

While numerous risk factors and precursors for AD have been identified in the medical literature, diagnosis of this degenerative disease in practice remains difficult, with high rates of diagnostic failure and misdiagnosis (i.e. Type I and II error) especially at early onset. We therefore seek to gain insight into which factors already known to reveal the presence of or susceptibility to AD might be used, individually or in combination, to identify likelihood of change in diagnosis over time, both among those already diagnosed and those who are cognitively normal.

This project was done by Nathan Einstein, Rory Maizels, Robbert Struyven and Abhimanyu Vasishth (Team 41 in AC209a taught in Fall 2018). Our website is [here](https://ac209a-alzheimersproject.github.io/alzheimers-project/).
