## Problem Description and Motivation

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) incurs a significant toll not just on the elderly individuals who are most prone to the disease, but to their caregivers and the population at large. As the sixth leading cause of death among American adults, the disease currently affects 1.6% of the American population, though the figure is projected to double to 3.3% by 2060 as the nation’s population ages and lifespans increase.[1]

While numerous risk factors and precursors for AD have been identified in the medical literature, diagnosis of this degenerative disease in practice remains difficult, with high rates of diagnostic failure and misdiagnosis (i.e. Type I and II error) especially at early onset.[2] We therefore seek to gain insight into which factors already known to reveal the presence of or susceptibility to AD might be used, individually or in combination, to identify likelihood of change in diagnosis over time, both among those already diagnosed and those who are cognitively normal.

## Data Source Description

The ADNI study is made up of four distinct phases -- ADNI1, ADNIGO, ADNI2, and ADNI3 -- in each of which new participants were recruited while existing participants from earlier phases continued to be monitored. This structure lends itself well to longitudinal modeling, though the variability in the information gathered on patients and inconsistent coding of variables across cohorts presents numerous data-cleaning and modeling challenges.

Numerous relational tables are made available with detailed information on patient background, clinical evaluations, cognitive test results, genetic information, PET and MRI images, and biomarker measurements, though the information in these tables are often inconsistent between study phases or missing for certain groups of patients, follow-up intervals, or phases. We therefore drew primarily on a prepared dataset (“ADNImerge”) containing key variables for patients across all four study phases. We also explored in greater detail original datasets on gene expression and family history -- two topics that we viewed as of potentially great importance in making predictions of change in patient outcomes.

## Research Questions

Our cross-sectional model predicting initial diagnoses reveals that cognitive assessment scores could account for much of the variability in patient diagnoses, in large part given the heavy reliance on these exams for the definition of the ADNI diagnosis classes. In fact, we obtain a training and test score of around 90% in predicting baseline diagnoses using just the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDRSB) scores. A model designed to predict diagnosis involving these exams as predictors therefore seemed of relatively little value.

Another area of exploration was using gene expression data to build a predictive model of diagnosis. For instance, Chromosome 21 is known to be very important in the etiology of AD - for example, over half of those born with an extra copy of Chr21 (a condition known as Down’s Syndrome) will go on to develop Alzheimer’s Disease. However, the preliminary models using here suggested little promise of interesting results to be derived from considering gene expression data in isolation. Additionally, it was found the the samples from which the data is derived were taken from blood, not the central nervous system, which means that the gene expression profiles are not indicative of the cellular environment in the brain, as the gene expression profiles of different tissues varies hugely and the central nervous system is separated from the rest of the body by a near-impervious blood-brain-barrier.

Thus, our main focus is on developing a predictive model of a patient’s prognosis (i.e. evolution over time) given the information available at the patient's baseline visit (t=0) and using these models for identifying strong predictors. We therefore develop two separate models: one for individuals who begin as cognitively normal, one for those diagnosed at baseline as having mild cognitive impairment.

It is important to keep in mind that the classes in our classification problem (Cognitively Normal, Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease) are not the "ground truth" i.e. doctors and diagnosticians use heuristics based on test scores such as the MMSE or CDRSB in order to assign these diagnoses to patients. Therefore, for the AC209 component of this project, we use some unsupervised learning algorithms to identify clusters of common groups along the AD/dementia spectrum that mimic the AD/LMCI/EMCI/CN diagnoses given to patients in the ADNI studies, to better understand to what degree these imposed diagnoses reflect natural breaks in the evolution of dementia.
